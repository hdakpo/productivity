Description: Levels and changes of productivity and profitability are measured 
  with various indices. The package contains Färe-Primont, Fisher, 
  Hicks-Moorsteen, Laspeyres, Lowe, and Paasche indices, as well as the classic 
  Malmquist productivity index. Färe-Primont and Lowe indices satisfy the 
  transitivity property and can therefore be easily used for multilateral or 
  multitemporal comparison. Fisher, Hicks-Moorsteen, Laspeyres, Malmquist, and
  Paasche indices are not transitive. All indices can also be decomposed into 
  different components, providing insightful information on the sources of 
  productivity and profitability changes. In the case of Malmquist productivity 
  index, the technological change index can be further decomposed into bias 
  technological change components. The package also allows to prohibit 
  technological regression (negative technological change). In the case of the 
  Fisher, Hicks-Moorsteen, Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive Färe-Primont 
  and Lowe indices, it is furthermore possible to rule out technological change. 
  Deflated shadow prices can also be obtained. Besides, the package allows 
  parallel computing as an option, depending on the user's computer 
  configuration. All computations are carried out with the nonparametric 
  Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and several assumptions regarding returns to 
  scale are available. All DEA linear programs are implemented using 'lp_solve'.
